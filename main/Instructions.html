                In this study, you will earn money by completing a task using your computer interface. 
                You will be presented with a 5x5 table. 
                Each box will contain either a 1 or a 0. 
                You are tasked with counting the number of 1â€™s within the table and entering that amount in the text box below the table. 
                Once you have entered your final answer, you will click submit. Once an entry is submitted a new 5x5 table will populate and the task will be repeated. 
                You may complete as many tables as you wish within a ten minute time frame. 
            </p>

            <!-- <img style="width: 100%" src="{{ static 'global/figure1.PNG' }}"/> -->

            <P>
                You will earn 9 cents for each correct entry. 
            </P>

            <p>
                After ten minutes, a new screen will indicate that the time allotted to earn money is over. 
            </p>

            <p>
                You will then be told how much money you earned in completing the task. 
                You will make a decision on how much of your earned income to report subject to a 40% tax. 
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                Before making a decision, you will be given information concerning whether others who previously completed the task reported the full amount of their earnings. 
            </p> -->

            <p>
                Once ready, you will use a slider to specify the amount of income you would like to report. 
                Moving the indicator to the right will increase the amount you report and moving the indicator to the left will decrease the amount you report. 
                A graph above the slider will indicate how much you will be paying in taxes based on how much you choose to report. 
                Moving the indicator all the way to the right will mean that you want to report your full earnings. 
            </p>
